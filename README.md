Zenei jelfeldolgozás 2013 C5 Nemlineáris multieffekt megvalósítása

This project was created as a home assignment for the course "Zenei jelfeldolgozás" at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. It contains two audio effects. Kex which is a compressor/expander and LiNg, a limiter/noise gate. Both are implemented using JUCE and VS 2013. Note that I didn't make the effort to write a makefile. In order to compile, you'll have to acquire VS 2013 or later and Steinberg's VST 2.4 SDK.
